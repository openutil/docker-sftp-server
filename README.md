# Docker SFTP Server

This dockerfile will allow you to create many SFTP servers. The data saved in the SFTP servers can be accessed from the host.

Authentication can be set up so that:

- You can log into all servers.
- Your customers can only log into their server.




### Quickstart

On your host machine:

```bash
# cloning this repository (the folder can be anything)
cd /opt
git clone https://github.com/42technologies/docker-sftp-server.git

# making initial directory structure
# - "data" directory will hold the data from sftp servers
# - "keys" directory can hold public keys that will allow login to ALL sftp servers
mkdir -p ./sftp/{data,keys}

# (optional) creating a key for global login
ssh-keygen -b 4096 -f ./sftp/sftp.key -q -N ""
cp ./sftp/sftp.key.pub ./sftp/keys

# building the docker image
docker build -t 42technologies/sftp docker-sftp-server

# running the sftp server
./docker-sftp-server/sftp-run.sh /opt/sftp jacobmarks 9000

# (optional) you can install public keys to allow login into the "jacobmarks" container
# cp jacobmarks.key.pub ./sftp/data/jacobmarks/keys

# (optional) or you can use the script to set a text password
# ./sftp-passwd.sh /opt/sftp jacobmarks

# connecting to the sftp server
sftp -i ./sftp/sftp.key -P 9000 42-data@localhost

# ... after put-ing files in the SFTP server, you can access them here
ls ./sftp/data/jacobmarks/data
```

Note that if you decide to install this stuff in a directory other than
`/opt`, you'll need to modify the command parameters accordingly.

### Detailed Installation Instructions

#### 1. Clone this repo and stick it somewhere

```
cd /opt
git clone https://github.com/42technologies/docker-sftp-server.git
```

#### 2. Create initial folder structure

```
mkdir -p /opt/sftp/{data, keys}
```

In the scripts, there is mention of a `<root>` argument. In this example, the `<root>` is `/opt/sftp`.

- The `/opt/sftp/data` directory will contain the data from the SFTP servers.
- The `/opt/sftp/keys` directory can hold public keys that will allow login to ALL sftp servers


#### 3. Build the docker image

```
docker build -t 42technologies/sftp docker-sftp-server
```


#### 4. Create an SFTP server for an organization 

Let's create an sftp container for organization `jacobmarks` that will run on port `10000`:

```
/opt/docker-sftp-server/sftp-run.sh /opt/sftp jacobmarks 10000
```

This creates a container that exposes it's SSH server via port `10000`. You
SFTP into the server by using `42-data` as the username, and port `10000`.

The `sftp-run.sh` script will create the directory `<root>/data/jacobmarks`.

The container will then be run, which upon starting will run a script that creates
the following directories (in the container):

- `/sftp/keys` which should contain org-level login public keys (maps to `<root>/data/jacobmarks/keys` in the host)
- `/sftp/data` which should contain the sftp data (maps to `<root>/data/jacobmarks/data` in the host)

Both of these directories will not be deleteable by the sftp user. 


#### 5. Authentication

##### a) Global Login

Access to all SFTP servers can be done by placing your public key in the `/opt/sftp/keys` folder.
This folder can contain any number of keys.

##### b) Organization-Level Login

After running the `sftp-run.sh` script for an organization, the organization's directory structure
will be initialized. You will then be able to place public keys in the `/opt/sftp/data/<organization>/keys`
directory.

If you want to use password-based authentication, you can use the `sftp-passwd.sh` script:

```
./sftp-passwd.sh <root> <organization>
```

#### 6. Connecting to the SFTP server

On some random machine, you can connect to the SFTP server by doing:

```
sftp -i <private key> -P <port> 42-data@<host>
```

Note that the private key is not necessary if you have set a password.

## Inside the SFTP server

As mentioned previously, each container only creates a single SFTP user: `42-data`. To "switch" accounts,
you just connect to a different SFTP server (aka use a different port).

The SFTP user will have full control over files in `/keys` and `/data`. The are however unable to delete
the directories. The SFTP user is also able to read anything that is placed in the `/` directory.

The idea here is that the user will upload his data to the `/data` folder, and he will upload his keys
to `/keys`.


## How does this authentication magic work?

We expose the host's `<root>/keys` directory to the container's `/keys` directory.

We configured SSHD to use the `AuthorizedKeysCommand` directive, which allows us call a script
to fetch the list of authorized public keys.

When a login attempt is made, `AuthrorizedKeysCommand` runs a script that concatenate all the public
keys in the `/keys` directory (global login) with the ones in `/sftp/keys` (org-level login). 



## Generating a key pair

Just as a reference, here's how you can generate keys using `ssh-keygen`:

```
ssh-keygen -b 4096
```


## How to create temporary containers, for testing and hacking

```
docker run -it \
-p <port>:22 \
-v /etc \
-v /home/core/sftp/keys:/keys \
42technologies/sftp bash
```

That should give you a shell with the sftp environment. To run SSHD in debug mode, do this:

```
/usr/sbin/sshd -d
```
